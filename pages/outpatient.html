                <h1 style="font-size: 16px;">THE 24HOUR ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY CENTER</h1>
                <p>Conveniently located at the main entrance of the Hospital. The Accident and Emergency Center is
                    manned by a specialist in emergency medicine and works in conjunction with the cardiac
                    catheterization Lab in management of heart attacks. The Centre is compliant to international
                    standards of emergency, trauma, life support and this has shaped the Hospital’s speedy response to
                    incidents, accidents and disasters.
                    Critical care is provided in the Critical Care Unit (CCU) and the High Dependency Unit (HDU) as a
                    continuum of the emergency care.<br>The staff members of the A&E recognize the need to treat
                    patients with utmost respect and professionalism. They go out of their way to ensure that patients
                    are attended to in a timely and effective way before discharge or transfer to inpatient wards.
                    The A&E partners with several consultants in management of patients as the need may arise. In
                    addition, there is collaboration with other medical centres from East and Central Africa who choose
                    to refer their patients to the Nairobi Hospital for further specialized management.<br>The Centre
                    has increased its capacity over the years and is now able to serve about <b>350 patients per
                        day</b>. The medical staff is made up of <b>25 doctors</b> and <b>44 nurses</b>. Moreover, there
                    is a fully fledged <b>Pediatric Department</b> that attends to an average of <b>70 patients</b> per
                    day.</p>
